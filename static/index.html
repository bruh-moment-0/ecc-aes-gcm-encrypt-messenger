  <p>
    based on ecc-aes-gcm-encrypt, this api is used for message transfer. please note that this web service could potentially change its domain, so be sure to check the domain from the link ("used in this") page below. however do not worry as any script using this app will not break, as long as the last link stays online!
    this api is ran by using render's free tier. please make sure to share this secure communication method. also please note that even tho all mesagges get stored in the servers ram (disk needs money and my budget is 0 cents), the data is so safely encrypted with https connections, general ECC, AES-GCM-256 encryption methods, nobody can decrypt your messages but the reciepent! so no more middle man attacks and stuff listening you talking with your grandmom or some.
